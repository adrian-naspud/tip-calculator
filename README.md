## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project taught me how to create different functions for each elements and how to put together different pieces to create one application. This project also put my logic knowledge into test on how to make each button work the way it should be by adding event listener to the elements along with the function. It also involve a lot of DOM manipulation. Overall, it really put my knowledge into test. 

### Continued development

In the future, I really want to make more project that can test my logic skills and see how far I can really go.
